California’s vision is to deliver seamless travel across multiple modes – interconnecting rail, metro, bus and private mobility providers – on a single ticket, with the aim of making public transportation easier, quicker, and more attractive to use that ever before.

The [California State Transportation Agency](http://www.calsta.ca.gov), in conjunction with [Caltrans](www.caltrans.ca.gov), the [Capitol Corridor Joint Powers Authority](www.capitolcorridor.org), and local, regional and state partners, has begun an integrated travel project (Cal-ITP) to research, plan and establish a statewide framework for multimodal transport interoperability, and culminate in a multi-year trial of a travel planning and and payment pilot including small, medium and large agencies, and private providers. 

The project will link California’s intercity passenger rail backbone with megaregional, urban and rural operators, delivering new connectivity options to encourage use while ensuring best value for travelers
